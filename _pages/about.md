My primary interests are microeconomic theory, market design, economics and computation, and industrial organization. My advisor is [Professor Paul Milgrom](https://milgrom.people.stanford.edu/).

I have a Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, where I was a John F Kennedy Fellow. I also hold a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in mathematics from the University of Queensland, where I was a University Medallist and Graduate of the Year in 2012.

I am from Brisbane, Australia. Between 2013 and 2016, I was the adviser to [Dr Jim Chalmers MP](https://jimchalmers.org/), then Shadow Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Shadow Minister for Sport.
