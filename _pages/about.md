I am a doctoral candidate and Stanford Graduate Fellow in the Department of Economics at Stanford University. My primary interests are microeconomic theory, market design, economics and computation, and industrial organization. My advisor is [Professor Paul Milgrom](https://milgrom.people.stanford.edu/).

I have a Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, where I was a John F Kennedy Fellow. I also hold a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in mathematics from the University of Queensland, where I was a University Medallist and Graduate of the Year in 2012.

I am from Brisbane, Australia. Between 2013 and 2016, I was the adviser to Dr Jim Chalmers MP, then Shadow Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Shadow Minister for Sport, and worked in the Australian Labor Party campaign headquarters during the 2016 Federal Election campaign. I was the Secretary of Australian Young Labor in 2014 and 2015 and President of Queensland Young Labor in 2013 and 2014.
