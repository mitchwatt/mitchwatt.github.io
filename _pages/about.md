I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Economics at Stanford University. My primary interests are microeconomic theory, market design, economics and computation, and industrial organization. My advisor is [Professor Paul Milgrom](https://milgrom.people.stanford.edu/). I am supported by the Koret Fellowship (part of the [Stanford Graduate Fellowship Program in Science and Engineering](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details)) and the [Ric Weiland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Weiland) Graduate Fellowship.

I have a Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, where I was a John F. Kennedy Fellow. I also hold a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in mathematics from the University of Queensland, where I was a University Medallist and Graduate of the Year in 2012.

I am from Brisbane, Australia. Between 2013 and 2016, I was the adviser to [Dr Jim Chalmers MP](https://jimchalmers.org/), then Shadow Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Shadow Minister for Sport.
