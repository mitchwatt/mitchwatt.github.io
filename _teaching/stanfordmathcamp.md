I was the instructor for the math camp for incoming economics PhD students (and other interested students) at Stanford University. This involved twenty two-hour sessions, with material including logic and sets, linear algebra, real analysis, introductory measure theory, convex analysis, static optimization, ordinary differential equations and optimal control theory. Notes to come, once corrected!
