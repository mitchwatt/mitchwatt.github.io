I was the instructor for the 2022 math camp for incoming economics PhD students (and other interested students) at Stanford University. This involved twenty two-hour sessions, with material including logic and sets, linear algebra, real analysis, introductory measure theory, convex analysis, static optimization, ordinary differential equations and optimal control theory.

Notes are available [here](https://mitchwatt.github.io/files/mathcampnotes22.pdf).

In Summer 2021, I was the instructor for the mathematics and economics boot camp for incoming masters students in public policy. This involved ten four hour sessions, covering undergraduate-level calculus and an introduction to microeconomic analysis and game theory (at approximately the level of Intermediate Microeconomics by Varian).
